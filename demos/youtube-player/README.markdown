This jQuery plugin builds a interactive youtube media player, allowing the user to view multiple videos within multiple playlists. 

The player is built using jQuery and uses the Youtube Javascript API to send and capture player events.

*Development approach:*

 * Clean UI
 * Small footprint
 * Customizable
 * Cross browser compatible

*Player consists of:*

 * The chromeless Youtube player (Flash 8)
 * Customizable toolbar 
 * Multiple playlists
 * jQuery UI Framework compatible
 * Hash actions (allowing you to link to videos in the playlist)

*Dependancies:*

 * flash plugin installed on browser
 * swfobject
 * jquery ui framework
 * mousewheel plugin (optional)

*Other info:*

 * The player currently requires a small PHP proxy script to retrieve the JSON playlist from youtube. If you can't use the PHP script, you can build the playlist manually in the playlist.js file.

*Demos:*

 * [Basic setup](http://badsyntax.github.com/demos/youtube-player/player-example.html)
 * Original concept: [http://dubstep.uk.net](http://dubstep.uk.net)
